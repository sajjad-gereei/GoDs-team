        While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.His acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out (1987), No Man's Land (1987) and Less than Zero (1987).In May 1987, he made his television debut in a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the CBS sitcom Trial and Error and the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Jenna Wade's daughter Charlotte (played by Shalane McCall).Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) was his first leading film role, starring as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997.Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.

        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt">Pitt</a> was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: "Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary."[26] The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image. His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder.The same year he featured in a Levi's jeans TV commercial based around the song "20th Century Boy" which played in the background.

    <h2>Breakthrough (1994–1998)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        In 1994, Pitt portrayed the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film <mark>interview with the Vampire</mark> : The Vampire Chronicles, based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name.He was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas.Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony,his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, "Brad Pitt [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side [...] he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis.
        <br>
        <br>

        Following the release of <mark>interview with the Vampire</mark>, Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall (1994),based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant,Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category.Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed,many film critics praised Pitt's performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, "Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way.The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.
